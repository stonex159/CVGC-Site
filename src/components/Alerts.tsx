            To change a yellow mark to a green mark you must have undergone testing for covid, 
            including the authorized covid shot(s). Please go to a UD Covid Testing facility to 
            be allowed into club and other UD facilities. 

            Please look <a href="https://www.udel.edu/home/coronavirus/testing/">here</a> for more information

            Notice: If you have had both shots but still have a yellow mark, please wait 2 weeks for the second shot to come into full affect.
            </p>
